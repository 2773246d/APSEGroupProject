# APSEGroupProject

The product we are making:
A key-value store
It will be in python so essentially a dictionary
Idea: a database where the keys are people's name and the values are the quotes (with the option to store the value as a list in order to store multiple quotes for a person)

Additional features we might like:
Functions indicating diagnostics (e.g. how many key-value pairs stored)
Collections as values
Storing database items (SQL lite as CSV is too simplistic)

Basic Functional Requirements:
Users should be able to store a key-value pair using your system. Food for thought: what happens if you have duplicate keys? Is this allowed? 
Users should be able to give your system a key and retrieve the Food for thought: what happens if the key doesnâ€™t have an associated value yet? associated value you have stored for that key. 
Users should be able to delete a value using its associated key. 
Users should be able to move a value from one key to another. 
Some way to update key-value pairs, separate to insertion
